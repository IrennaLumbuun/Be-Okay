        <p align="justify">Long, long time ago there was a website called The Thoughts Room. 
            In it, you can write out all your thoughts and watch it disappears into stars. 
            For a lot of people, including myself, this website <em> literally</em> saved their life. 
            It was a beautiful and comforting way to declutter our mind, 
            especially at times when we can't talk to other people. 
        </p>

        <p align ="center">
            However, it <a href="https://www.twitter.com/amitayt/status/1116674874053996545" target= "_blank">disappears</a> one day. 
        </p>

        <p align ="justify">
            Having missed The Thoughts Room and knowing how it has helped a lot of people, 
            I decided to rebuilt a similar website during this quarter break (Fall 2019). I tried to include features that I love about The Thoughts Room.
            <br><br>
            <em>This</em> is the best I could come up with so far.

            Fellow coders? Help me make this site better! Link to github: <a href="https://github.com/IrennaLumbuun/Let-It-Rain" target= "_blank">here</a>
            <br> I'm quite new to git and github repositories, so I haven't configured most stuffs.
